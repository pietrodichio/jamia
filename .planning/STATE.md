## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 3 min
- Total execution time: 0.3 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Monorepo Migration | 4/4 | 17 min | 4 min |
| 2. Open Source Preparation | 2/3 | 3 min | 2 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-03 (10 min), 01-04 (1 min), 02-02 (1 min), 02-03 (2 min)
- Trend: Phase 2 in progress - documentation tasks highly efficient

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Turborepo for monorepo (industry standard, supports selective deployment)
- Geolocation + manual search for location (covers local users and travelers)
- Crowdsourced events without approval (lower barrier, trust community)
- Only jams are managed, other events are listings only (keeps scope focused)
- Use @jamia/ namespace prefix for all workspace packages (prevents conflicts)
- Placeholder types in packages/types (real types extracted in Plan 03)
- Git subtree for repository migration (preserves full history and author attribution)
- Interfaces not classes in shared types (types-only, no runtime code)
- Backend DTOs implement shared interfaces (maintains class-validator decorators)
- Jest moduleNameMapper for workspace imports (resolves @jamia/types in tests)
- Railway watchPaths for selective deployment (native monorepo support)
- Netlify ignore command with git diff (workaround for selective deployment)
- Turborepo filter in deployment builds (build only target app)
- Single root README instead of app-level READMEs (monorepo best practice)
- Explicit .env.example references in setup instructions (addresses OSS-02)
- Document monorepo commands at root level (pnpm install, pnpm --filter)
- Disable blank issues to force template use (improves issue quality)
- Link to GitHub Discussions for questions (keeps issues for actionable items)
- Use markdown templates over YAML forms (simpler, more flexible)
- Document repository settings in version control (maintainer continuity)
